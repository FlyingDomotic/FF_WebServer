# FF_WebServer
 This library implements a fully asynchronous ESP8266 WebServer

## What's for?

This library implements on ESP8266 a fully asynchronous Web server, with:
- MQTT connection
- Arduino and Web OTA
- local file system to host user and server files
- file and/or browser based settings
- full file editor/upload/download
- optional telnet or serial or MQTT debug commands
- optional serial and/or syslog trace
- optional external hardware watchdog
- optional Domoticz connectivity

This code is based on a highly modified version of https://github.com/FordPrfkt/FSBrowserNG, itself a fork of https://github.com/gmag11/FSBrowserNG, not anymore maintained.

## Prerequisites

Can be used directly with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

The following libraries are used:
- https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP
- https://github.com/gmag11/NtpClient
- https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
- https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson
- https://github.com/FlyingDomotic/FF_Trace
- https://github.com/arcao/Syslog
- https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client
- https://github.com/joaolopesf/RemoteDebug

## Installation

Clone repository somewhere on your disk.
```
cd <where_you_want_to_install_it>
git clone https://github.com/FlyingDomotic/FF_WebServer.git FF_WebServer
```

## Update

Go to code folder and pull new version:
```
cd <where_you_installed_FF_WebServer>
git pull
```

Note: if you did any changes to files and `git pull` command doesn't work for you anymore, you could stash all local changes using:
```
git stash
```
or
```
git checkout <modified file>
```
Warning: as files in data folder should be downloaded on ESP file system, it may be a good idea to check if some of them have been changed be a new version, to update them on your ESP.

Remind also that config.json and userconfig.json are specific to your installation. Don't forget to download them from your ESP before making a global file system upload.

## Documentation

Documentation could be built using doxygen, either using makedoc.sh (for Linux) or makedoc.bat (for Windows), or running
```
doxygen doxyfile
```

HTML and RTF versions will then be available in `documentation` folder.

## Files to be modified by user to implement required behavior

By design, library contains common part of code that implement standard function. Only few files should be modified to implement user's needs. These files are:
- index_user.html: contains user's specific part of index.html, which is the web server main page
- userconfigui.json: if user wants to permanently store parameters, this file describe fields to be displayed to input/modify them.

Have a look to example files to get an idea of what could be put inside them. FF_WebServerMinimal folder contains empty examples while FF_WebServerStandard shows full implementation.

Details of routines that are available in FF_WebServer are described at end of this document.

## Parameters at compile time

	Not define FF_TRACE_USE_SERIAL
	Define NO_SERIAL_COMMAND_CALLBACK

## Debug commands

Debug commands are available to help understanding what happens, and may be a good starting point to help troubleshooting.

Debug output is available on Telnet, Serial and Syslog. Note that settings can disable some of these outputs.

### Access
Debug is available through:
- Telnet: connect with a telnet tool on ESP's port 23, and strike commands on keyboard
- MQTT: send the raw command to mqttCommandTopic (don't set the retain flag unless you want the command to be executed at each ESP restart)
- Serial: send the command on Serial, prefixing it by SERIAL_COMMAND_PREFIX (i.e. command:vars`)

### Commands
The following commands are allowed:
	- ? or h or help: display this message
	- m: display memory available
	- v: set debug level to verbose
	- d: set debug level to debug
	- i: set debug level to info
	- w: set debug level to warning
	- e: set debug level to errors

## Available Web pages

- / and /index.htm -> index root file
- /admin.html -> administration menu
- /general.html -> general settings (device name)
- /ntp.html -> ntp settings
- /system.html -> system configuration (file system edit, HTTP OTA update, reboot, authentication parameters)
- /config.html -> network settings
- /user.html -> user specific settings

## Interactions with web server

Three root URLs are defined to communicate with web server, namely /rest, /json and /post. /rest is used to pass/return information in an unstructured way, while /json uses JSON message format. They both are using GET HTTP format, while /post is using HTTP POST format.

## Available URLs

WebServer answers to the following URLs. If authentication is turned on, some of them needs user to be authenticated before being served.

### Internal URLs
- /list?dir=/ -> list file system content
- /edit -> load editor (GET) , create file (PUT), delete file (DELETE)
- /admin/generalvalues -> return deviceName and userVersion in json format
- /admin/values -> return values to be loaded in index.html and indexuser.html
- /admin/connectionstate -> return connection state
- /admin/infovalues -> return network info data
- /admin/ntpvalues -> return ntp data
- /scan -> return wifi network scan data
- /admin/restart -> restart ESP
- /admin/wwwauth -> ask for authentication
- /admin -> return admin.html contents
- /update/updatepossible
- /setmd5 -> set MD5 OTA file value
- /update -> update system with OTA file
- /rconfig (GET) -> get configuration data
- /pconfig (POST) -> set configuration data
- /rest -> activate a rest request to get some (user's) values (*)
- /rest/values -> return values to be loaded in index.html and index_user.html (*)
- /json -> activate a rest request to get some (user's) values (*)
- /post -> activate a post request to set some (user's) values (*)

### HTML files (in addition to available web pages described before)
- /index_user.html -> user specific part of index.html (*)
- /favicon.ico -> icon to be displayed by browser

### JSON files
- /config.json -> system configuration data (!)
- /userconfig.json -> user's configuration data (!)
- /userconfigui.json -> user's specific configuration UI data (*)

### JavaScript files
- /microajax.js -> ajax minimalistic routines
- /browser.js -> FF_WebServer browser side JS functions
- /spark-md5.js -> md5 calculation function

### CSS files
- style.css -> CSS style file

(*) Should be adapted by user to specific configuration
(!) Could be adapted by user to initially set configuration values (i.e. server's ip or port, SSID...)

## Examples

- FF_WebServerMinimal: contains minimalistic data and routines to be provided to template
- FF_WebServerStandard: contains all data and routines to implement common functionalities

Files destination: FF_WebServerCFG.h should be copied in FF_WebServer library folder, other .h files should be moved into root folder, to be compiled. .json and .html files should be moved into data folder, to be loaded on ESP file system.

Note also that /data folder of FF_WebServer library should be copied into /data folder in user implementation code.

### DEBUG_COMMAND_CALLBACK()

This routine is called when a user's debug command is received.

User should analyze here debug command and execute them properly.

Note
- Note that standard commands are already taken in account by server and never passed here.

Parameters
- [in]	command	last debug command entered by user

Returns

Returns
- true if command is known, else false 


### ERROR404_CALLBACK()

This routine is called when a 404 error code is to be returned by server User can analyze request here, and add its own. In this case, it should answer using a request->send(<error code>, <content type>, <content>) and returning true.

If no valid answer can be found, should return false, to let template code returning an error message.

If no valid command can be found, should return false, to let server returning an error message.

Note
- Note that minimal implementation should support at least /rest/values, which is requested by index.html to get list of values to display on root main page. This should at least contain "header" topic, displayed at top of page. Standard header contains device name, versions of user code, FF_WebServer template followed by device uptime. You may send something different. It should then contain user's values to be displayed by index_user.html file.

## Content of a typical user INO (or cpp) file

Easiest way is to have a look at "FF_WebServerStandard" example, which contains all available functions. You may want to copy it, and remove unused/not needed parts before adding your own code.
